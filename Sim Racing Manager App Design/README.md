Sim Racing Manager Design
===================


This folder has mainly the design documentation for a mobile/web application that I am in the process of developing. The premise is to develop a test case for a application for those who want to monitor a simulation racing league (I.E.- iRacing, rFactor, etc.). This is only the design documentation and I am using this to show off some of my thought processes and workflow in my UI/UX designing skills. 

----------


Documents
-------------

The documents that I am including in this folder are:

 - Journey Maps
 - Scenarios
 - Wire-frames
 - Color, logo, and Documents
 - Mock-ups

Current Developments
-------------
Currently, the parts that have been completed are: 

 - Journey Maps
 - Scenarios

I am currently working on the Wire-frames for the site/app. These will include Wire-frames for the:

 - Home Page
 - Log-in/Register Page
 - League Page
 - Standings Page
 - Edit Page
 - Media Page

These Wire-frames will be with pencil/paper, then transitioned into Balsamiq. Depending on if I could viably transfer the pictures to my PC, I might include them in a separate folder in the Wire-frames folder. Otherwise, I could produce them, physically, if asked.

Once the Blueprint for the site is completed, I will start creating logos, color schemes, and design documentation, for the site. I will include a separate folder for each in the "Color, Logo, Documents" folder. 

Then finally, I will create and put everything together in the Mock-up folder. This will be the final look of the site, and will be created using a combination of Photoshop and Illustrator. 

Updates
-------------
If I have any updates, I will format it like this:

[Item Name]**(Update! on [Month, Day, Year] )**

Feel free to Watch/Star this folder if you want to be kept up to date on this app's design developments!
